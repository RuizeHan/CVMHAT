Annotation format: 
We provide the annotation for human bounding box with the format of both '*.xml' or '*.txt'.

The '*.xml' file follows the standard VOC format.
Each line in '*.txt' file includes a subject with the format of 'frame_id subject_id x y w h -1 -1 -1 -1', where (x,y) is the coordinate for the top left corner and (w,h) denotes the width and height of the bounding box.
